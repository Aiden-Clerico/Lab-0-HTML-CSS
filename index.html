      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Aiden Clerico and I am a fourth-year Finance and Information Systems student
         at The Ohio State University Fisher College of Business. I am minoring in both Business Analytics 
         and Music Media. Throughout my time at OSU, I’ve also had the pleasure of building my passion of 
         teaching through being a Teaching Assistant for Operations Management 3230. With that, I get to 
         reinforce my academic and social skills while bettering others simultaneously. I am interested in 
         a business analytics position, where my love for math and analytics can be combined with the 
         skills learned through my other classes, making me a well-rounded problem solver. In my free time, 
         I love to exercise, play piano, and am a member of the STEM Scholars, OSU Indoor Soccer Club, and 
         BuckeyeThon.</p>
